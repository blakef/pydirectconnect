pyDirectConnect: A commandline direct connect client written in Python:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction:
----------------

pyDirectConnect joins a host of other direct connnect (DC) clients made
available.  The aim of this project is to allow access to automated scripts
to a DC network, basically because we're looking to study what's on them
and how it changes.

You can, however, use it for anything unless you're an MPAA puppy or
someone wishing to inflict similar suffering on people :).

2. Where we're at:
------------------

The code is quite unstable, and really just a hack.  I wanted to get it out
ASAP so people could clean it up as much as possible.  I've got a thesis to
write and can no longer spend as much time on it as I wish.  Well I can,
but my supervisor might not be a happy person.

3. Using it:
------------
Edit network.py, you'll find a sample program.  I'll be working on
restructuring the program.  It doesn't make sense (at the moment), and
if the Hub doesn't play nicely it falls over quite quickly.

Ciao,
Blake
